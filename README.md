This is third attempt at repository 
This is third attempt at commit 
This projects goal is to gain more knowledge about the software word adding terminology I am learning 
A # symbol is to indicate I am adding a definition of something for your reference, let's begin. 
# Version Control System: this is what Git hub is, it is another word for it. 
#Version Control: is how you keep track of code changes. 
#Directory: your folder, another term for the meaning of the same thing. 
#CLI: is the abbreviation for command line interface. 
#CD: indicates "change directory" 
#Code Editor: Is essentially a location in which you can write your code. Codes are unique ways to indicate seomting means something else. A secret language almost. It is like Michelle Language but for computers and technology. 
Within Github you can write code anywhere, I am writing code as we speak in my own unique language that the computer will eventually recognize. 
#Repository: your "git" "project" "folder" all in where your project is located and stored. The beginning stepping stone to create your project the repository is of essence. 
#Clone: bring somehthing elsewhere 
#Add: track changes 
#Commit: is when you save files in your Git. You are commiting to it! COMMIT! 
#Push: when you upload files 
#Pull: is a indication that changes were made. 
Plus button at the top of your profile, is to be clicked when you are creating a new repository for all your projects, and any application you are buidling. The software world is a unique langauge I have zero knowledge about. It is important to learn this language in order to grasp a better understanding of it. 
#Main Header 
#LA: list everything in the directory 
I think it is important to never take on a job because of money. They have indicated people take on this job as a software engineer because it pays well. I think its ok to want to have a paying job because it pays well but you should also have some passion about it as well. I rather have not a lot of money and be happy then stuck in a job I hate. 
We start coding by figuring out what we want to do. It sounds simple but is necessary to have a idea pf where to begin. 
We are essentially beginning with a problem and making it into smaller probems until it can be solved. 
As yourself these following questions... 
Do you want to develope a application? 
Do you want to make a bot? #ROBOT ATTACK RAWR 
Do you want to make a website? (I was thinking of making a website for pet sitting called Mishu and Kovus Pet sitting) We will see. I guess learning to code is a good idea for this purpose. 
Know the languages and tools you need for coding. Keep your specific purpose in mind. 
Learn to Hack? Would be cool. 
Data base tchnology is cool. 
Learn basics of the language you need. 
Create a basic application. Start simple. baby steps. Baby mishu steps at a time. One step two step, three step, four. 
I want to make a small game. It would be cool to start to code for this. I need to get my X- box fixed. 
Below of a list of the various languages used in coding 
#C++
#Javascript which includes Loops, If statements, Variables, Functions and Arrays. Further detail to come. 
#Python (can I see your python) 
I need to learn 
#html
#CSL 
C#
#Swift
Don't over complicate things begin with a Simple BASIC application like a basic white girl at Starbucks. 
Learn to create functions. 
So many languages which one do I pick? 
It is recommended to start with python so I will be doing that. I has simple syntax. Just to refresh yourself here is the definition of syntax. 
#Syntax the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.
"the syntax of English"
a set of rules for or an analysis of the syntax of a language.
You got this you smart cookie. Have a cookie later. But not the cookikes on this laptop its not real. 
Look up how to start coding with Python later. 
Look into debugging 
#Debugging: get ride of the errors and bugs, search for the errors others may have similar errors. 
Stack Overflow? 
#Version Control System like mentioned before, its having different versions of esentially the sae thing. 
Choose tool based on the language 
How do you choose a project? 
Once again should be simple, ask yourself what you are interested in? Like for example I like Volleyball, Swimming, Wolves the Color green and bub.Can make a project based off your interests. 
Or a project about world hunger. The possibilities are endless. Make email applications. Something you are passionate about. In lign with your interests. Cool!  
Jango Jango what a fun name. Jango Jango.

There ae different courses you cna take online for training I recommend to myself i do this. Courses to take are as listed below. 
#Python Certification Training Course 
#Pythonf for Data Science training Course 
#NLP training using Python 
#Python Django training and Certification 
I think I will take one of these courses. 
Try to get a certification and build your skills. 
Will take a month to learn to basics. Lets get going. 
#AN INVESTMENT IN KNOWLEDGE ALWAYS PAYS BEST INTEREST 
I have decided to take a online Python course with certification for free let's get started. I will write important imformation below. 
INTRO TO PYTHON 
#PYthon is a free and open source program. Plug and Play. 
It is open source. 
#Open source means you can modify the code. 
Python is cross platform compatible 
#Cross Platform Compatible: Can run language on any operating system. Windows, Max ... doesn't matter. 
I am going to download python for easier access. 
Python has begun downloading. We will naviate the site shorlty. 
#IDE: interactive develpment elignment 
My Anaconda navigator don't want none unless you got buns hun 
#Introduction to juniper notebook 
Do I need a juniper notebook? 
shorcuts exist 
Example of a code you can create 
#print("thisisspartaaaaaaaa") the click run to run your code 
thats a python code, were on our way to hacking NASA systems LETS GOOOOO 
#Variables and Data types in Python 
How do we store data? 
We store them in variables 
Another example of creating a code in python from the course 
# employee_name " "Kamran" employee_name then you run code. We are inventing as we go. So if it is working properly you would have types out the original code "Kamran" employee_name and then when you write employee_name "Kamran" should pop up. 
the variable is a temporary storage place. When you change the name when you put employee name again a different name will pop up. 
Heres some other examples I am creating myself using the above example as a reference. 
# favourite color "green" favourite_color and then when you write favourite_color "green should pop up. here are more examples below.
#Dogs name "Kovu" Dogs_name "Kovu" and then when you write Dogs_name "Kovu should pop up. We are getting smarter and more wise as we go. 
Every variable is associated with a #Data type look at the different data types below. 
#int: 10,500. Can have minus 1 minus hundred. 500 thousand etc.
#float: 3.14,15.97 sounds like pie to me. Numbers with are decimal points. 1.9848 doesnt matter.
#Boolean: TRUE,FALSE. Treu and false values. 
#String: "Sam", "Matt". Characters kind of data. 
Lets practice below with the different kind of data 
#int example: a1= 100
              a1
              100             
lets test out type functions. type(a1) when you click run will be like int. 
a1=3.14
type(a1) when you click ruun float should appear. 
More examples below 
a1=True 
a1=
true 
type(a1)
bool
#string example 
a1= "spartaaaa!!" (we just stored spartaaaa)
a1
'spartaaaa!!"
type(a1) run 
str
#complex numbers example will have real and imaginary parts. 
a1=3+5j
a1
(3+5)
type(a1) run will appear as 
complex 
#OPERATORS IN PYTHON 
#Arithemitic operators a=10 b=20 run you have plus minus multiplication and division. 
first arithemic operator is addition 
a+b run (so 10 plus 20) 
30 because 10 is stored in A and 20 is stored in B 
next arithimitic operator subtraction 
a-b run
-10 
NOTE** a-b and b-a will get you different results 
b-a run 
10 
Third type of arithemetic operator multiplication 
NOTE * (star) means multiplication) 
a*b 
200 
Fourth artithemetic operator division 
NOTE* / means division 
a/b run 
0.5 
we are moving onto the next kind of operator 
#Relational Operators this includes < and > greater than and less than as well as equal to and not equal to. Symbols for these to come later. 
Once again a=10 b=20 
a>b run 
False because 10 is not greater than 20 silly salmon sausage. 
a<b 
True because 10 is less than 20. 
a==b using two equal symbols to see if equal to eachother 
false because 10 is not equal to 20 
NOTE = means equal ! (explanation mark means not equal) 
lets try a is not equal to b. 
a!=b run  
True because 10 is not equal to 20. 
Can play around and change the values of a and b to get differet results 
#LOGICAL OPERATORS "and", "or" and "not" and and & same thing. 
&
a=true 
b= False run 
a&b  (true and false) will give us a false value because one of the operants is false. Run 
false 
b&a 
false 
b&b run 
false (bs are both false) 
a&a run
True 
Note | is a pipe operator stands for or. 
| true. 
a|b run 
True. It is true because at least one of the operants represented by a number is true. 
b|a run 
True 
a|a run 
true because both operants are true 
b|b  run 
False because both operants are false. 
#TOKENS IN PYTHON smallest meaningful components in a program. The four tokens include 
#Keywords
#Identifiers 
#Literals 
#Operators 
#KEYWORDS are special reserved words such as 
#False 
#None
#True 
#and 
#as
#class
#continue
#def
#del 
#elif
#Finally 
#is 
#For 
#From 
#Global 
#iF
#Is 
#Lambda
#Nonlocal 
#Not 
#or
#Return 
#Try 
#While 
#With 
#Yield 
they give meaningful information. Special word performs special function. Errors occur when theres a duplicate word that is also a special key word. The computer never lies. 
when there is a key word and you click Run a special script will run since it is a key word. 
#Identifiers are names used for variables functions or objects.
#Rules for identifiers... no special character except _ underscore, identifiers are case sensitive, first letter cannot be a didget. 
#Example 
Lisa=" I am Lisa" run 
lisa="I am l" run 
Lisa run 
"I am lisa" 
lisa run 
"I am l" 
#NOTE the capatilization of L and l is making a difference once you run your script. Different results appear. Pay attention to detail! 
#NOTE literals are constant in Python 
A ... I AM A CONSTANT I DON'T CHANGE 
#STRINGS IN PYTHON 
#Python Strings are a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes ('') double quotes ("") or triple quotes (("'"') 
example single quotes 'Hello World' 
example double quotes "This is Sparta" 
example triple quotes "' I am going to france tomorrow"' 
More examples 
s1= 'Hello World'run 
s1 run 
'Hello World' 
type (s1) run 
str
s1= "This is spartaaaa" 
s1 run 
"This is spartaaaa" 
type (s1) 
str
s1= "'this is multiline
string
"'
s1
' this is multiline\nstring\n'
my_string= "My name is Kamran" 
My string [0]
You can extract certain characters from the sentence 
for example 
my_string "My name is Kamran" 
my_string [0]
"M"
You have three basick string functions 
#Finding length of string 
#Converting string to lower case 
#Converting string to upper case 
They are talking about the nitty gritty about this will go into details when comes the time. 
#Python Tuples 
#DATA STRUCTURE IN PYTHON 
Tuple, list,dictionary,set 
#TUPLE is a order ofcollection of elements enclosed with ()
#TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE GOD DAMNIT THEY DONT HAVE EMOTIONS or in other words cant change there values. 
ex. tup1= (1,'a,True) differnt data we learned earlier now all in one. 
Creating a tuple example 
#Tuple
tup(1,"a",True,2,"b"False) run 
tup 1
(1,a, True,2,'b',False) 
type(tup1) 
tuple is a tuple. 
can extract individual elements. 
#List in python 
#LISTS are an ordered collection of ordered elements enclosed with []
LISTS ARE WHAT? LISTS ARE MUTUABLE 
In order words can be modifiable 
Example l1[,"sparta,3.14,True,3+5j] 
l1
type (l1) 
list
#DICTIONARY is a unordered collecion of key-value pairs enclosed with {}mutable 
example fruit = {'apple':50,'banana',:30'orange':40'peach':100}
#SET in python is an unordered and unindexed collection of elements enclosed with {}
NOTE duplicates are not allowed in set 
#If statements in python 
pick between two options. 
ex. If its raining stay inside. If its not raining go outside and platy football. 
Example 
a=10
b=20 
if a>b:
print ("a is greater than b") 
if b>a: 
print ("b is greaer than a") 
if a<b:
print ("a is less than b") 
if b<a:
print ("a is not greater than b") 
#LOOPING STATEMENTS IN PYTHON 
used to repeatthe task multipple times 
While Loops 
While condition: execute statement 
#Basic Problems in Python 
Lets just try not to have them! But rememebr the computer is always right. Its going to typically come up red. 
#Functions in Python 
#Function is a block of code whoch performs a specific task 
#Deposit: function to deposit money 
#Withdraw: function to withdraw money 
#Balance: Function to check balance 
We creat funcitons for these (a shortcut) 
#Normal function syntax: def fnction name - executive statements 
#Lamda function syntax; lambda arguments: expression 
Example def 
def hello():
print ('Hello World') run
hello()
Hello World
