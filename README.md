This is third attempt at repository 
This is third attempt at commit 
This projects goal is to gain more knowledge about the software word adding terminology I am learning 
A # symbol is to indicate I am adding a definition of something for your reference, let's begin. 
# Version Control System: this is what Git hub is, it is another word for it. 
#Version Control: is how you keep track of code changes. 
#Directory: your folder, another term for the meaning of the same thing. 
#CLI: is the abbreviation for command line interface. 
#CD: indicates "change directory" 
#Code Editor: Is essentially a location in which you can write your code. Codes are unique ways to indicate seomting means something else. A secret language almost. It is like Michelle Language but for computers and technology. 
Within Github you can write code anywhere, I am writing code as we speak in my own unique language that the computer will eventually recognize. 
#Repository: your "git" "project" "folder" all in where your project is located and stored. The beginning stepping stone to create your project the repository is of essence. 
#Clone: bring somehthing elsewhere 
#Add: track changes 
#Commit: is when you save files in your Git. You are commiting to it! COMMIT! 
#Push: when you upload files 
#Pull: is a indication that changes were made. 
Plus button at the top of your profile, is to be clicked when you are creating a new repository for all your projects, and any application you are buidling. The software world is a unique langauge I have zero knowledge about. It is important to learn this language in order to grasp a better understanding of it.

#LA: list everything in the directory
