This is third attempt at repository 
This is third attempt at commit 
This projects goal is to gain more knowledge about the software word adding terminology I am learning 
A # symbol is to indicate I am adding a definition of something for your reference, let's begin. 
# Version Control System: this is what Git hub is, it is another word for it. 
#Version Control: is how you keep track of code changes. 
#Directory: your folder, another term for the meaning of the same thing. 
#CLI: is the abbreviation for command line interface. 
#CD: indicates "change directory" 
#Code Editor: Is essentially a location in which you can write your code. Codes are unique ways to indicate seomting means something else. A secret language almost. It is like Michelle Language but for computers and technology. 
Within Github you can write code anywhere, I am writing code as we speak in my own unique language that the computer will eventually recognize. 
#Repository: your "git" "project" "folder" all in where your project is located and stored. The beginning stepping stone to create your project the repository is of essence. 
#Clone: bring somehthing elsewhere 
#Add: track changes 
#Commit: is when you save files in your Git. You are commiting to it! COMMIT! 
#Push: when you upload files 
#Pull: is a indication that changes were made. 
Plus button at the top of your profile, is to be clicked when you are creating a new repository for all your projects, and any application you are buidling. The software world is a unique langauge I have zero knowledge about. It is important to learn this language in order to grasp a better understanding of it. 
#Main Header 
#LA: list everything in the directory 
I think it is important to never take on a job because of money. They have indicated people take on this job as a software engineer because it pays well. I think its ok to want to have a paying job because it pays well but you should also have some passion about it as well. I rather have not a lot of money and be happy then stuck in a job I hate. 
We start coding by figuring out what we want to do. It sounds simple but is necessary to have a idea pf where to begin. 
We are essentially beginning with a problem and making it into smaller probems until it can be solved. 
As yourself these following questions... 
Do you want to develope a application? 
Do you want to make a bot? #ROBOT ATTACK RAWR 
Do you want to make a website? (I was thinking of making a website for pet sitting called Mishu and Kovus Pet sitting) We will see. I guess learning to code is a good idea for this purpose. 
Know the languages and tools you need for coding. Keep your specific purpose in mind. 
Learn to Hack? Would be cool. 
Data base tchnology is cool. 
Learn basics of the language you need. 
Create a basic application. Start simple. baby steps. Baby mishu steps at a time. One step two step, three step, four. 
I want to make a small game. It would be cool to start to code for this. I need to get my X- box fixed. 
Below of a list of the various languages used in coding 
#C++
#Javascript which includes Loops, If statements, Variables, Functions and Arrays. Further detail to come. 
#Python (can I see your python) 
I need to learn 
#html
#CSL 
C#
#Swift
Don't over complicate things begin with a Simple BASIC application like a basic white girl at Starbucks. 
Learn to create functions. 
So many languages which one do I pick? 
It is recommended to start with python so I will be doing that. I has simple syntax. Just to refresh yourself here is the definition of syntax. 
#Syntax the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.
"the syntax of English"
a set of rules for or an analysis of the syntax of a language.
You got this you smart cookie. Have a cookie later. But not the cookikes on this laptop its not real. 
Look up how to start coding with Python later. 
Look into debugging 
#Debugging: get ride of the errors and bugs, search for the errors others may have similar errors. 
Stack Overflow? 
#Version Control System like mentioned before, its having different versions of esentially the sae thing. 
Choose tool based on the language 
How do you choose a project? 
Once again should be simple, ask yourself what you are interested in? Like for example I like Volleyball, Swimming, Wolves the Color green and bub.Can make a project based off your interests. 
Or a project about world hunger. The possibilities are endless. Make email applications. Something you are passionate about. In lign with your interests. Cool!

There ae different courses you cna take online for training I recommend to myself i do this. Courses to take are as listed below. 
#Python Certification Training Course 
#Pythonf for Data Science training Course 
#NLP training using Python 
#Python Django training and Certification 
I think I will take one of these courses. 
Try to get a certification and build your skills. 
Will take a month to learn to basics. Lets get going. 
#AN INVESTMENT IN KNOWLEDGE ALWAYS PAYS BEST INTEREST
